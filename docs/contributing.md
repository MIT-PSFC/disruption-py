# Contributing
## Prerequisities
- You have access to DIII-D or Alcator C-Mod servers 
- Cristina Rea has given you access to the private repository
- You have a GitHub account
## Setting up development environment
I recommend forking the repository and cloning it to your local folder on whatever cluster you're using. Install in edit mode following the instructions in the installation guide. You should then be all be set to begin development. You're also welcome to use the main repository but please make sure to create your own branch to work in.
## GitHub Issues
I think GitHub Issues is a great way to track bugs as well as feature requests and development. If you find a bug, please submit an issue on the repository. If you'd like a significant feature change/addition or are planning to implement one yourself, please submit an issue as well. This will allow for useful discussion and collaboration among contributors.
## Coding and Style Guidelines
In general, try to follow Google coding style guidelines for python. Every new method, class, module, or script should not be committed without a descriptive docstring.
## Submitting Changes
Please submit all code changes as PRs, pull requests, from your forked repository or personal branch to either the main branch or the relevant cluster-specific branch: d3d, cmod or east. PRs will be reviewed within 1-3 days moving forward.  
## Easy ways to start contributing
- Check out TODOs and QUESTIONs in the codebase for potentially easy contributions
- Add missing documentation to functions and calculations you are knowledgeable about

## Communication Channels(TODO: Link)

## Important Notices and Warnings
While the project is currently private, **please be sure to include no confidential information such as usernames or passwords directly in the codebase**. The repository will likely eventually become public. Also, **please don't commit data from servers that you don't have express permission to move off their network.**
