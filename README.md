# DisruptionPy

## Installation 
The following command will install the disruption warning package locally in develop mode. In develop mode, changes to the directory used for installation will be reflected in the installed package.    

CMOD:  
```
pip3 install --user -e /home/hmturner/disruption_py
```
D3D:
```
pip3 install --user -e /fusion/projects/disruption_warning/disruption-warning-db-workflow/
```

NOTE(not true just yet): The directory for installation is not the one I use for daily development and I will only push changes to it that have been tested. 
## Getting Started
